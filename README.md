Hello my name is Erik Luis Lanuza Oehlerich and welcome to my repository for making a shiny app with leaflet.

In this repository i will add all my files and code in a organised way:

There is a free use of what i add of files and code as long it is for a noncomercial or a scientific use and i am creditted by my full name, somewhere public in your work. Either add "Erik Luis Lanuza Oehlerich" or you can add an abbreviation "E.L.L.O" to your document.

If you are going to try and remake what i have made, then follow these steps.

1. Download the file clean_dataset_ww1_danes.csv and save it in your folder
2. Download the file lat_long and save it as well.

3. Then download and open the main file called Mainmapfile_WW1_Map
4. Load all the libraries, you might have to install some of them, but do that first before you do anything else.
5. Very important !! Make sure that you are loading the clean_dataset_ww1_danes.csv from the right place and use the read_delim like in my code or you will get problems.
6. Import into the enviroment, the file called lat_long because you will need it.
7. Then start going through and activating all the code by holding ctr+enter
8. If you did all the things and read the code then you should be able to get a shiny app to pop up that has a leaflet map that is interactive and with two filters.

Im not 100% done yet there are still alot of diffrent thing im going to improve, as i get around to them. 
I need to improve the places of death so they dont show up the wrong places and i still need to make my tabbar function.

Here is a short video of how it looks like when it is all setup:
